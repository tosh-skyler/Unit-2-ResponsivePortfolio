            <p>Salutations to you reader, welcome to my portfolio page. My name is Skyler Tosh and I'm currently working towards a certification full stack web-development.</p>
    
            <p>Previous to working on the certification I was a student at Olympic College, working towards a degree in computer science. Though, the certification will not be a replacement for a full college degree. I'm only earning the certification to get real world experience in development and strengthen my knowledge.</p>
    
            <p>In the job market, I'm currently working at a Wendy's in Kirkland, in able to pay for college courses and the certification course. Especially since I am a student just out of high school.</p>
